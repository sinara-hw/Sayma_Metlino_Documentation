Glossary
========

* AFE 
	Analogue front-end.
* AMC Module
	An AMC Module is a mezzanine or modular add-on card that extends the functionality of a Carrier Board. The term is also used to generically refer to the different varieties of Multi-Width and Multi-Height Modules.
* BaseMod 
	Base-band input/output mezzanine.
* COTS
	Commercial off-the-shelf. Product which is designed and can be easily purchased.
* EEM
	Eurocard Extension Module is a Sinara standard for low-cost, low-bandwidth peripherals that are controlled by ARTIQ DRTIO.
* Fat Pipes
	Ports 4 though 11 of the AMC Connector constitute the Fat Pipes Region. This Region of Ports is intended for the assignment of multiple Lane interfaces, also called “fat pipes”. Fat Pipe 1 [Ports 4-7], Fat Pipe [Ports 8-11].
* FMC
	FPGA Mezzanine Card
* Hot Swap
	To remove a component (e.g., an AMC Module) from a system (e.g., an AMC Carrier	AdvancedTCA Board) and plug in a new one while the power is still on and the system is still operating.
* IPMB
	Intelligent Platform Management Bus. The lowest level hardware management bus as described in the Intelligent Platform Management Bus Communications Protocol	Specification.
* Management Power or MP
	The 3.3V power for a Module's Management function, individually provided to each Slot by the Carrier
* MGT
	Multi-Gigabit Transceiver.
* MixMod
	An up-converting mezzanine, using an analogue IQ mixer to mix the input and output RF signals with a LO supplied by Sayma.
* MMC
	Module Management Controller. The MMC is the required intelligent controller that manages the Module and is interfaced to the Carrier via IPMB-Local.
* RFBP
	RF Backplane.
* RTM
	Rear Transition Module.
* Sayma
	Smart Arbitrary Waveform Generator, providing 8 channels of 1.2 GSPS 16-bit DACs (2.4 GHz DAC clock) and 125 MSPS 16-bit ADCs. It consists of an AMC, providing the high-speed digital logic, and a RTM, holding the data converters and analog components.
* Sianra
	Open-source hardware ecosystem originally designed for use in quantum physics experiments running the ARTIQ control software. It is licensed under CERN OHL v1.2.
* uTCA
	Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture. MicroTCA is a modular, open standard for building high performance computer systems in a small form factor.
